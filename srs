You are a Software Requirements Analyst. I will give you a scenario, and you must create a complete IEEE-SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document based on that scenario.

The SRS must strictly follow the IEEE standard format and include the following sections:
1. Introduction
   - Purpose
   - Document Conventions
   - Intended Audience
   - Product Scope
   - References

2. Overall Description
   - Product Perspective
   - Product Functions
   - User Classes and Characteristics
   - Operating Environment
   - Design and Implementation Constraints
   - User Documentation
   - Assumptions and Dependencies

3. External Interface Requirements
   - User Interfaces
   - Hardware Interfaces
   - Software Interfaces
   - Communication Interfaces

4. System Features
   - Feature Description & Priority
   - Stimulus/Response Sequences
   - Functional Requirements

5. Non-Functional Requirements
   - Performance
   - Safety
   - Security
   - Software Quality Attributes
   - Business Rules

6. Annexures
   - Appendix A: Glossary
   - Appendix B: Analysis Models
   - Appendix C: TBD items

Write the SRS clearly, professionally, and with examples wherever needed.
